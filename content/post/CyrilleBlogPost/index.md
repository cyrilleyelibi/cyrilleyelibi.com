Using AI to Generate and Analyze African Cuisine

The Challenge of African Food Datasets

One of the biggest obstacles to applying AI in African cuisine research is the scarcity of well-structured, high-quality datasets. Unlike Western cuisines, which dominate recipe databases, African culinary traditions are underrepresented. This makes it difficult for AI models to generalize and generate meaningful, culturally relevant food data.

Text Generation

The study used Googleâ€™s Gemini-1.5-Flash model to generate African recipes. The process involved:

Prompt Encoding: The input text was tokenized and converted into numerical representations.

Probability Estimation: The model predicted the most likely next words based on context.

Token Sampling: The model selected the next word to ensure coherence.

Iterative Generation: The model continued generating text until a stopping condition was met.

This was the first process of the study. I will be posting the next part later.
